  - [ ] Number bank generation
  - [ ] Validation logic

- [ ] API Endpoints
  - [ ] New game generation endpoint
  - [ ] Move validation endpoint
  - [ ] Game state management

### Frontend Development (Vue.js)
- [x] Project Setup
  - [x] Vue.js initialization
  - [x] Component structure
  - [x] Basic routing

- [ ] UI Components
  - [x] Basic component structure
  - [x] Component placeholders
  - [ ] Grid display implementation

## Phase 2: Multiplayer Support ü§ù (Future)
- [ ] Real-time Updates
  - [ ] WebSocket integration
  - [ ] State synchronization
  - [ ] Player presence system

## Testing & Refinement üîç
- [ ] Backend Tests
  - [ ] Puzzle generation tests
  - [ ] Validation logic tests
  - [ ] API endpoint tests

- [ ] Frontend Tests
  - [ ] Component rendering tests
  - [ ] User interaction tests
  - [ ] State management tests

- [ ] Integration Tests
  - [ ] End-to-end gameplay tests
  - [ ] Mobile device testing
  - [ ] Browser compatibility tests

## Deployment üöÄ
- [ ] Local Development Setup
  - [ ] Development environment documentation
  - [ ] Setup instructions
  - [ ] Running locally guide

## Current Focus üéØ
We have completed the initial Vue.js setup and created component placeholders. Next steps are:
1. Implementing the game grid layout and interaction
2. Creating the number bank component with draggable numbers
3. Setting up the game state management with Pinia

## Notes üìù
- We're following the simple layout approach as shown in the screenshot
- Mobile-first development with fixed grid size (8x8 maximum)
- Click-to-select interaction model chosen over drag-and-drop
- Single player implementation first, multiplayer as future enhancement
